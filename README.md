# Slowlychangingdimention-SCD-Notes
This Notes contain  the concept of Slowly Changing Dimension (SCD) in SnowflakeDB and its types - SCD 1, SCD 2, SCD 3, and SCD 6 with an example. I used a customer table with basic columns and dummy data to apply each type of SCD one by one for better understanding.
